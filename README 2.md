## What is it?
**MorningDew is a morning routine task timer for people with ADHD.**

With ADHD, it's easy to get distracted, especially in the morning. A 15-min routine can turn into an hour :flushed:

Using multiple engaging techniques to minimise distractions, MorningDew aims to get you up and ready in as little time as possible.

**Technologies used:** SwiftUI, SwiftData, Combine, Observation, AVFoundation & TipKit.

## Features

:stopwatch: **Visual Timer:** keep you from losing track of time.

:musical_note: **Fast-paced Music:** get you to move and keep your pace up.

:rotating_light: **Check-up after every Task**: sound an alarm if thereâ€™s no response.

:lotus_position: **Breathing Sessions:** allow for a short moment to breathe if you feel overwhelmed.
